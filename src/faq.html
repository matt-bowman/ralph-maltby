                  <blockquote>Ralph, what’s your professional opinion of triangular shaped driver heads?</blockquote>
                  <p>Anthony, for the most part, shapes are mostly marketing. The U.S.G.A. has so many restrictions on driver design that the manufacturers needed some place to go to keep interest in high priced drivers.Most of the shapes have been tested extensively and they do work (as well as a normal more conventional shape). If a shaped (triangular in your case) driver works for you when you demo it; then use it, but do not expect any more of a miracle than you would get from another well designed normal shaped modern technology driver.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <blockquote>I’ve had a basic understanding of what MOI is but recently a golfing buddy asked why the square clubheads in drivers havemoreMOI than themore round ones. I couldn’t answer that one.</blockquote>
                  <p>Brice, picture an overlay drawing from the top view of both the Nike SQ Sumo round 460cc driver and the SQ Sumo2 square 460cc driver. If you looked down at the drawing (overlay) you would see the square rear corners of the square driver protruding farther out than the round driver in this area.</p>
                  <p>This added protrusion of the rear corners distributes more weight to the rear and more weight to the outside of the head. The designers also add more weight in this area inside the head to accentuate the weight shift The farther out from the heads center of gravity that you distribute the weight the higher the moment of inertia.</p>
