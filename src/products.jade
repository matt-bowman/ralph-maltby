                    a(href="#") Maltby Tour Grind MG Wedges
                p The Maltby MG Tour Grind Wedges were designed for the player that demands creativity around the greens. The sole design of the MG Tour Grind Wedges features a narrow sole with an exaggerated toe and heel Tour Grind making them the most versatile wedges ever designed under the Maltby brand. Micro Grooves (MG) have been CNC milled into the face to consistently increase spin around the greens.
                p The Diamonized Black Metal finish is a very thin chemically implanted coating that is twice as durable as traditional nickel chrome plating and 30 times more durable PVD coatings typically found on modern black wedges. The DMB finish will not “crack” or “peel” when being bent to custom specs yet is so strong it will actually extend the sharpness and overall shape of the precision milled MG grooves vs. any other wedge finish currently available. If you desire a wedge that allows for the ultimate in consistency and creativity, the Maltby MG Tour Grind wedges are the answer!

                h3 Maltby TE Forged Irons
                p New for 2010, the Maltby M-Series Tour Edition Forged Irons replace the popular MTF Forged Irons. The Tour Edition Forged Iron club head has been developed based on customer request for a traditional cavity back design with less graphics. The exceptionally clean look of the M-Series TE irons along with a traditional blade profile appeals to the better players and traditionalist looking for more forgiveness.
                p The TE Forged irons are the result of a tireless five step forging process that starts with a raw billet of 1035 carbon steel and through a series of 5 different forging dies and multiple heat treating process’ creates an incredibly precise finished head requiring very little surface grinding. Typical forged cavity backs only utilize one forging die and have to be hand ground into the final shape and head weight, causing inconsistencies in every clubs specifications from one club to the next. By optimizing the center of gravity position, the Maltby TE Forged irons offer Super Game Improvement playability, combined with the exceptional feel and look of a true forged, players cavity iron.
